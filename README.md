# randomizer

Description:

Randomizer is a simple and versatile number generator written in Rust. This command-line tool allows users to generate unique random numbers within a specified range, while also providing the option to exclude certain numbers from the generated set. Whether you need random lottery numbers, unique identifiers, or any other random sequence, Randomizer has you covered.

Key Features:

Generate a specified number of random integers within a given range.
Exclude specific numbers from the generated set using an ignore list.
Choose between ordering the generated numbers or leaving them unordered.
Utilizes the secure rand::rngs::OsRng random number generator for improved randomness and security.
Provides feedback when the requested number of unique numbers cannot be generated due to insufficient available options.
User-friendly command-line interface for easy input and interaction.
How to Use:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have the latest version of Rust installed on your system.
Navigate to the project directory using the terminal.
Run the program using the command cargo run.
Follow the on-screen prompts to enter the required input values.
The program will generate the requested random numbers and display the results.
